## Day 2 Afternoon Session: APIs, Synthetic Data & Monitoring

### 0. Architect-Recommended Data Strategy üèóÔ∏è **NEW APPROACH**


Implement layered data strategy:
- [ ] **Reference Data** (via migration): Currencies, order statuses, payment types
- [ ] **Bootstrap Service**: Minimal operational data endpoint
- [ ] **Synthetic Data API**: Full test data generation
- [ ] **Scenario-Based Generators**: Complex e-commerce patterns
- [ ] 

### 1. FastAPI Application Setup (1.5 hours) üéØ **HIGH PRIORITY**
- [ ] Create src/api/ structure with routers
- [ ] Set up async SQLAlchemy 2.0 sessions
- [ ] Generate Pydantic v2 models from DB schema
- [ ] Add API versioning via headers (not URL)
- [ ] Create health/readiness endpoints
- [ ] Enable auto-generated OpenAPI docs
- [ ] Add CORS and security middleware

### 2. Synthetic Data Generation (1.5 hours) üéØ **ARCHITECT-ALIGNED**
- [ ] Create layered data generation framework:
  - [ ] Base `DataGenerator` abstract class
  - [ ] Model-specific generators (CustomerGenerator, ProductGenerator)
  - [ ] Scenario-based generators (BlackFridayScenario, SeasonalScenario)
- [ ] Implement Factory Boy patterns for consistency
- [ ] Build REST endpoints:
  - [ ] POST /api/synthetic/reference-data (minimal bootstrap)
  - [ ] POST /api/synthetic/generate/{model}
  - [ ] POST /api/synthetic/scenarios/{scenario}
  - [ ] POST /api/synthetic/bulk-generate
- [ ] Add progress tracking for large datasets
- [ ] Create CLI commands in justfile

### 3. Observability Setup (1 hour) üöÄ **QUICK WIN**
- [ ] Add Prometheus + Grafana to docker-compose
- [ ] Configure PostgreSQL exporter
- [ ] Add FastAPI metrics middleware:
  - [ ] Request duration histogram
  - [ ] Error rate counter
  - [ ] Active connections gauge
- [ ] Create auto-provisioned dashboards
- [ ] Set up structlog for JSON logging
- [ ] Add correlation IDs to requests

### 4. CDC Pipeline Foundation (1 hour) üîÑ **CORE CAPABILITY**
- [ ] Add Redpanda (not Kafka) to docker-compose
- [ ] Configure PostgreSQL for logical replication
- [ ] Set up Debezium PostgreSQL connector
- [ ] Create topics for each table
- [ ] Add Redpanda Console for monitoring
- [ ] Test with sample transactions
- [ ] Add CDC health checks to monitoring

---

## Deliverables Checklist

### Morning Session
- [x] Complete e-commerce data model documentation
- [x] PostgreSQL schema SQL files (sql/schema/001_initial_schema.sql)
- [ ] DynamoDB schema design document
- [x] Migration scripts ready (Alembic fully configured with justfile commands)
- [x] Data quality rules defined (via constraints and triggers)
- [ ] Event schema registry design

### Afternoon Session
- [ ] FastAPI application running
- [ ] Synthetic data generation API
- [ ] Prometheus metrics exposed
- [ ] Grafana dashboards created
- [ ] Health check endpoints working
- [ ] CDC pipeline capturing changes

---

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Can generate 1000 customers, 5000 orders in < 10 seconds
- [ ] API documentation auto-generated at /docs
- [ ] Database migrations tested with rollback
- [ ] Grafana dashboards show key metrics
- [ ] CDC events visible in Redpanda Console
- [ ] All health checks passing

## Architect-Recommended Execution Order

**Phase 1: Foundation (1 hour)**
1. Create minimal reference data migration (currencies, statuses)
2. Set up FastAPI project structure with proper layering

**Phase 2: Core API (2 hours)**
3. Build FastAPI with async SQLAlchemy sessions
4. Generate Pydantic models from SQLAlchemy
5. Create health/readiness endpoints

**Phase 3: Data Generation Framework (2 hours)**
6. Implement base DataGenerator classes
7. Create model-specific generators
8. Build synthetic data API endpoints

**Phase 4: Advanced Features (2 hours)**
9. Add scenario-based generators
10. Implement bulk generation with progress tracking
11. Set up monitoring stack (if time permits)

## Key Architecture Decisions

1. **Use Redpanda instead of Kafka** - Simpler, no Zookeeper, Kafka-compatible
2. **Skip Great Expectations for now** - Pydantic validation is sufficient
3. **Defer DynamoDB** - Focus on PostgreSQL CDC first
4. **API versioning via headers** - More flexible than URL versioning
5. **Factory Boy over Faker alone** - Better referential integrity

## Actual Completion Status (2025-07-31)

### ‚úÖ Fully Completed

- **Migration Framework**: Alembic fully configured with async support and alembic_utils
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive model tests, fixtures, pytest-asyncio

- **Type Safety**: Strict typing enforced, no Any types allowed
- **Documentation**: Consolidated docs, development rulebook, optimized CLAUDE.md

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Completed
