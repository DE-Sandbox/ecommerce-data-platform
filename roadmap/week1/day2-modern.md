# Week 1 Day 2: Data Models, APIs, Synthetic Data & Monitoring (2025)

> **Status**: Planning
> **Prerequisites**: Day 1 infrastructure fully operational (LocalStack, Terraform, Docker)

## Overview
**Goal**: Design data models, create APIs, synthetic data generation, and establish monitoring  
**Approach**: Schema-first design with observability from day one  
**Stack**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.0, Faker, Prometheus, Grafana
