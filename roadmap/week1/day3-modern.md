## GitHub Actions Pipeline Structure

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Lint with Ruff
      - name: Type check with mypy
      - name: SQL lint with SQLFluff

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.11, 3.12, 3.13]
    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:15
      localstack:
        image: localstack/localstack:latest
    steps:
      - name: Run unit tests
      - name: Run integration tests
      - name: Generate coverage report
      - name: Upload coverage to Codecov

  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run Trivy scanner
      - name: Run CodeQL analysis
      - name: Check for secrets

  build:
    needs: [lint, test, security]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Build Docker images
      - name: Push to registry
```

## Key Testing Patterns

### 1. Fixture Hierarchy
```python
# Base fixtures for all tests
@pytest.fixture
async def db_session():
    """Transactional test database session."""

@pytest.fixture
async def test_client():
    """FastAPI test client with auth."""

@pytest.fixture
async def test_data_factory():
    """Factory for creating test data."""
```

### 2. Parametrized Tests
```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("payment_type,valid", [
    ("credit_card", True),
    ("invalid_type", False),
    ("", False),
    (None, False),
])
async def test_payment_type_validation(payment_type, valid):
    """Test all payment type validations."""
```

### 3. Transaction Rollback
```python
@pytest.fixture
async def transactional_db():
    """Auto-rollback database for tests."""
    async with engine.begin() as conn:
        await conn.begin_nested()
        yield conn
        await conn.rollback()
```
