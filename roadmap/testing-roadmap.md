- Factory Boy
- Local databases

### Phase 2: CI/CD Integration (Week 2)
- GitHub Actions
- Parallel execution
- Coverage reporting
- Test result tracking

### Phase 3: Advanced Testing (Week 3)
- Load testing (Locust)
- Contract testing (Pact)
- Mutation testing
- Property-based testing

### Phase 4: Production Testing (Week 4)
- Synthetic monitoring
- Canary testing
- A/B test framework
- Observability tests

## Key Testing Principles

1. **Test First**: Write tests before implementation
2. **Test Pyramid**: More unit tests, fewer E2E tests
3. **Fast Feedback**: Tests must run quickly
4. **Deterministic**: No flaky tests allowed
5. **Maintainable**: Clear, documented, DRY tests
6. **Realistic**: Use production-like data
7. **Comprehensive**: Cover happy path + edge cases

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Areas (Test First)
1. Payment processing
2. Inventory management
3. Order calculations
4. Security boundaries
5. Data consistency

### Medium Risk Areas
1. Search functionality
2. Recommendation engine
3. Email notifications
4. Report generation
5. API rate limiting

### Low Risk Areas
1. Static content
2. UI preferences
3. Non-critical logs
4. Optional features
