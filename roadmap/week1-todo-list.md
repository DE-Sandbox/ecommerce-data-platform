## Critical Path Items (Must Complete)
1. **Day 1**: Development environment with UV/Ruff
2. **Day 2**: LocalStack and Docker setup
3. **Day 3**: CI/CD pipeline foundation
4. **Day 4**: Terraform modules structure
5. **Day 5**: API and data generation
6. **Day 6**: Basic monitoring setup
7. **Day 7**: E2E validation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Local development environment fully functional
- [ ] All services running in Docker
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline executing on every commit
- [ ] Terraform can deploy to LocalStack
- [ ] API endpoints tested and documented
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards accessible
- [ ] Can deploy to AWS (dry-run validated)

## Risk Mitigation
- **LocalStack limitations**: Document any services that don't work locally
- **Resource constraints**: Use Docker resource limits to prevent system overload
- **AWS costs**: Ensure all Terraform includes lifecycle rules and auto-shutdown
- **Complexity creep**: Maintain focus on MVP functionality
- **Tool learning curve**: Allocate extra time for new tools (UV, Ruff, LocalStack)

## Daily Practices
- Start each day with tool/service health check
- Commit code at least twice daily
- Update documentation as you work
- Test everything in LocalStack before AWS
- Review AWS cost explorer (once deployed)
- Keep a decision log for architecture choices
