# Test Fix Summary - 2025-08-01

## Overview
Successfully fixed all failing tests in the model layer. All 39 model tests are now passing.

## Tests Fixed

### 1. test_base.py (6/6 tests passing)
- Fixed `get_async_session()` to work as async context manager by adding `@asynccontextmanager` decorator
- Fixed Customer model usage to match actual schema (no direct first_name/last_name fields)
- Added unique values to avoid constraint violations
- Fixed table name from `audit.audit_logs` to `audit.audit_log`

### 2. test_models_basic.py (6/6 tests passing)
- Fixed unique constraint violations by adding UUID suffixes to test data
- Updated Customer model usage to create CustomerPII separately
- Fixed all CRUD operations to match actual model structure

### 3. test_order.py (7/7 tests passing)
- Fixed Order model to use cents-based fields instead of decimal fields
- Updated to use JSON address fields instead of foreign keys
- Fixed OrderItem to include required fields (sku, name)
- Added unique order numbers to avoid constraint violations
- Removed references to non-existent fields (promo_code, fulfillment_status)

### 4. test_customer.py (7/7 tests passing)
- Updated all tests to use CustomerPII for name fields
- Fixed Address model to use `type` instead of `address_type`
- Added unique emails to avoid constraint violations
- Removed references to non-existent fields (customer_segment, lifetime_value)
- Fixed geolocation to use address_metadata JSON field

### 5. test_product.py (8/8 tests passing)
- Completely rewrote tests to match actual Product/Category model structure
- Added ProductPrice model usage (prices are separate from products)
- Fixed field names (display_order vs sort_order)
- Added unique values for all SKUs, slugs, and names
- Removed references to non-existent fields (price, cost, is_digital)

### 6. test_reference_data_schema.py (5/5 tests passing)
- All tests were already passing - no changes needed

## Key Model Insights Discovered

1. **Customer Model**: Names are stored in separate CustomerPII table, not directly on Customer
2. **Order Model**: Uses integer cents fields, not decimal; addresses are JSON, not foreign keys
3. **Product Model**: Prices are in separate ProductPrice table; no direct price field
4. **Address Model**: Field is named `type`, not `address_type`
5. **All Models**: Need unique values for constrained fields (email, SKU, slug, order_number)

## Migration Status
- Reference data migration successfully created and applied
- Categories and Locations (warehouses/stores) properly seeded

## Next Steps
1. Build FastAPI application structure
2. Implement synthetic data framework
