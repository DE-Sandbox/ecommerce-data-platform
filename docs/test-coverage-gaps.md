# Test Coverage Gaps Analysis

> **Generated**: 2025-08-01  
> **Status**: Current test coverage focuses on basic CRUD operations  
> **Critical Finding**: Significant gaps in business logic, constraints, and workflow testing

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive functional testing review has identified critical gaps in test coverage. While basic model operations are tested, the test suite lacks coverage for:
- Payment processing workflows
- Inventory management operations  
- Shopping cart functionality
- Database constraint validation
- Concurrent operation handling
- End-to-end business workflows

## Test Coverage by Model

### ✅ Adequately Tested Models
- **Customer**: Basic CRUD, soft delete, relationships
- **Product**: Basic operations, categories, pricing
- **Order**: Creation, status transitions, items
- **Base Models**: UUID v7, timestamps, audit fields

### ❌ Untested Models
- **Payment & PaymentMethod**: No test coverage
- **Inventory**: No test coverage
- **Cart & CartItem**: No test coverage
- **Review**: No test coverage
- **CustomerConsent**: No test coverage
- **Address**: Limited test coverage

## Critical Test Gaps by Priority

### 🔴 Critical Priority (Week 1-2)

#### 1. Payment System Tests
```python
# Required test cases:
- Payment method validation (all types)
- Payment transaction state machine
- Refund and partial refund processing
- Payment failure scenarios
- Currency consistency validation
- Token security validation
```

#### 2. Inventory Management Tests
```python
# Required test cases:
- Quantity calculation constraints
- Stock reservation/release workflows
- Negative quantity prevention
- Multi-location inventory tracking
- Concurrent inventory adjustments
- Reorder point triggers
```

#### 3. Order Integrity Tests
```python
# Required test cases:
- Total calculation validation
- Line item calculations
- Currency precision/rounding
- Discount application rules
- Tax calculation verification
```

### 🟡 High Priority (Week 2-3)

#### 1. Constraint Validation Tests
- CHECK constraint violations
- UNIQUE constraint edge cases
- Foreign key cascade behaviors
- Soft delete interaction with constraints

#### 2. Concurrency Tests
- Optimistic locking conflicts
- Race conditions in inventory
- Simultaneous default setting
- Transaction isolation levels

#### 3. Shopping Cart Tests
- Cart session management
- Guest vs authenticated carts
- Cart merging on login
- Cart expiration handling
- Price consistency checks

### 🟢 Medium Priority (Week 3-4)

#### 1. Business Workflow Tests
- Complete order fulfillment
- Return and refund process
- Customer registration flow
- Email verification process
- GDPR consent management

#### 2. Edge Case Tests
- Boundary value testing
- Null/empty value handling
- Maximum length validations
- Date/time edge cases
- Large dataset performance

## Test Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Days 3-4)
- Create comprehensive test fixtures
- Implement test data factories
- Fix existing test failures
- Set up test utilities

### Phase 2: Model Coverage (Week 2)
- Payment system tests
- Inventory management tests
- Shopping cart tests
- Review system tests

### Phase 3: Integration Tests (Week 2-3)
- Cross-model relationships
- Business workflow validation
- Constraint verification
- Transaction testing

### Phase 4: Advanced Testing (Week 3-4)
- Performance testing
- Concurrency scenarios
- Security validation
- API contract testing

## Testing Best Practices

### 1. Fixture Management
- Use factory pattern for complex models
- Leverage reference data from migrations
- Create reusable test scenarios
- Maintain test data isolation

### 2. Test Organization
- One test file per model
- Separate unit and integration tests
- Group related test cases
- Use descriptive test names

### 3. Assertion Strategy
- Test both success and failure paths
- Validate all constraint violations
- Check side effects and state changes
- Verify error messages

### 4. Performance Considerations
- Use transactions for test isolation
- Minimize database setup/teardown
- Parallelize independent tests
- Profile slow test cases

## Metrics to Track

### Functional Coverage

- [ ] All business rules validated
- [ ] All error scenarios handled
- [ ] All workflows verified

### Technical Coverage
- [ ] All models have test files
- [ ] All constraints are tested
- [ ] All relationships verified
- [ ] All calculations validated

### Quality Metrics
- [ ] Test execution time < 5 minutes
- [ ] Zero flaky tests
- [ ] Clear failure messages
- [ ] Maintainable test code

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Document in Day 3+ roadmap items
2. **Week 1**: Implement critical payment and inventory tests
3. **Week 2**: Complete model test coverage
4. **Week 3**: Add integration and workflow tests
5. **Ongoing**: Maintain test quality and coverage
